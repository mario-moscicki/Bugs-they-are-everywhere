### Pid litacka

I noticed 2 persistent bugs, 


1.	In the "departures" tab  
-- the application likes to remember your home location, even though you may be in a completely different place in Prague. The button which is supposed to specify the location from the built-in map does not help. I have to close my apps, delete from cache and run app again.
2.	In Map tab:  
-- The context menu (with information about timetables) for the selected public transport stops doesnâ€™t want to load - the application must be closed, deleted from the cache and run again. 

- reinstalling the application did not fix them
